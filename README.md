### The LOTR Basemap (Lord of the Rings) was inspired by the maps you would see in the first page of the books. The fonts I used in this basemap, I downloaded from a fan Lord of the Rings website which feature such fonts as Ringbearer and Hobbiton. I wish I could get more of a canvas texture to the map, but sadly have been unable. The hillshade in this map is more defined to really emphasize physical features. Waterways are also more prominent. I would like to add better labels to represent mountain ranges. I created this basemap from an empty style. What motivated me to create this map is a long term dream of creating an Oregon map drawn by Bilbo Baggins.
### The Dark Traffic Basemap is inspired by a commercial style map, with cursive labels that really pop. I started with orange as the water body color, but this conflicts with the trafic congestion layer. I started with Mapbox's Dark Traffic and customized nearly everything. Roads and labels are more prevelant than the original and I use fonts that bring a unique feel. What motivated me to create this dark traffic map is my Corvallis Night walk map I created for my story map. I may eventually add sidewalks and street lights to this map.
